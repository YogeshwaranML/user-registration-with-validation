User Registration with Validation Project

Phase 5 — Project Demonstration & Documentation

1. Final Demo Walkthrough

The project demonstrates a user registration system with client-side and server-side validation.

Step 1: User opens the registration page.

Step 2: Inputs required details (username, email, password, confirm password, etc.).

Step 3: Client-side JavaScript validates input fields (email format, password strength, required fields).

Step 4: If all validations pass, the form is submitted.

Step 5: Server-side validation ensures security (duplicate email check, sanitized inputs).

Step 6: User data is stored in the database, and a success message is displayed.

2. Project Report
Problem Background

Web applications require secure and accurate user data collection. A registration system with validation ensures only valid data is stored, preventing errors and malicious entries.

Objective

To build a secure and user-friendly registration form.

To implement real-time input validation.

To integrate client-side & server-side validation.

Methodology

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (form & validation).

Back-end (optional): Node.js / PHP (for storing data).

Database: MySQL / MongoDB (user details).

3. Screenshots / API Documentation
Screenshots

Registration Page UI – clean form design.

Validation Errors – when incorrect data is entered.

Successful Registration Message – confirmation screen.

API Documentation (if backend is included)

POST /api/register

Request: { "username": "john", "email": "john@email.com", "password": "12345" }

Response: { "success": true, "message": "User registered successfully" }

4. Challenges & Solutions

Handling invalid inputs like wrong email format	Implemented regex validation in JavaScript
Preventing weak passwords	Added password strength rules (min length, uppercase, number, special char)
Duplicate email registration	Backend check before inserting data
Styling error messages consistently	Used CSS error classes and inline alerts
